Your .gitignore looks solid. By ignoring bin/ and your hidden "dot-program" directories like .changelog and
.agenti, you've cleanly separated your environmental configuration (what Git tracks in $HOME) from your installed toolset.

The Big Picture
Your $HOME Git history now purely tracks how your machine behaves (aliases, tmux binds, global ignores).
The tools themselves stay in their own repos, which is exactly how "pro" dotfile managers (like stow or chezmoi) handle complexity.
